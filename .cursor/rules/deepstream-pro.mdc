# Mandatory Preflight (evidence required)
Before proposing any solution:
1) **Summarize** (3–7 bullets total) the most relevant parts of:
   - **Primary Source (Local Docs):** The distilled documentation in `/docs/deepstream-docs/`. Start with the `README.md` to navigate.
   - **Secondary Source (Fallback):** If the local docs are insufficient, consult the official NVIDIA Dev Guide (TOC + specific components you intend to use) → https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/
2) **Map requirements → built-ins** by **exact element name** with 1‑line purpose each, referencing `docs/deepstream-docs/02_GStreamer_Plugins.md`.
3) **Cite at least one sample** (name + path) from `docs/deepstream-docs/03_Sample_Applications.md` that demonstrates the pattern you’ll use.
4) **Declare config keys** you’ll touch and why (e.g., `batch-size`, `interval`, tracker params, analytics ROI polygons, tiler layout).

# Working Principles
- Prefer **SDK features** over custom plugins; justify any plugin with a brief **gap analysis**.
- Keep pipelines **reproducible**: provide full `gst-launch-1.0` or DS config file(s) and a **How to run** snippet.
- Keep scope **tight** to acceptance criteria; extras become new issues.

# Output Contracts (must appear in the agent’s message)
## A) PLAN (short)
- **Approach**: why these DS elements
- **Dependencies**: DS/TRT versions assumed; call out potential mismatches
- **Acceptance criteria**: FPS target, resolution, basic stability
- **Handoff**: next step (GRAPH → FORGE)

## B) PIPELINE & CONFIGS
- **Runnable** `gst-launch-1.0 ...` (single line) **or** DS `.txt` files (inline or file list)
- **Knobs touched**: list and justify (`interval`, `batch-size`, tracker cfg, analytics zones)
- **Diagram**: mermaid or ASCII block diagram of the graph

## C) EXCLUSION ZONES (if applicable)
- Define **polygon(s)/rect(s)** per source in a separate include or dedicated section.
- Use **two `nvdsanalytics` instances** when it simplifies disjoint zone logic (e.g., art-on-wall filters).
- Provide a **coordinate table** (normalized or pixel, specify which) and a **note on scaling** to the source resolution.

## D) BENCH (quick)
- **Command used**, **environment note** (GPU, res, batch), **numbers**: `fps`, `latency_ms`, optional `gpu.util`.
- **Verdict**: PASS/FAIL vs target and one sentence of interpretation.

## E) DOCS TOUCH
- README/USAGE: run steps, key flags/paths, where to edit zones, known limitations.

# Acceptance Checklist (agent must tick in output)
- [ ] Preflight summary from local `docs/deepstream-docs/` included
- [ ] Built-ins selected with rationale (by exact element names)
- [ ] At least one relevant **sample** cited from local docs
- [ ] Runnable pipeline/config provided
- [ ] Key knobs listed with reasons
- [ ] Exclusion zones defined (if relevant) with scaling note
- [ ] Bench numbers + verdict reported
- [ ] README/USAGE updated

# Stop & Ask Triggers
- Missing or vague acceptance criteria
- DS/TRT version mismatch likely to change behavior
- Attempt to re‑implement a feature that DS already offers (without a gap analysis from local docs)
