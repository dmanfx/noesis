# RTSP Production Test Results & Fixes

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing of the RTSP pipeline has revealed that **basic RTSP connectivity works perfectly**, but the segmentation fault occurs specifically during **TensorRT inference engine initialization**. The issue is not with RTSP streaming itself, but with the integration of TensorRT inference in the DeepStream pipeline.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ **Successful Tests**
1. **Basic RTSP Streaming** - `gst-launch-1.0` successfully streams from all configured RTSP sources
2. **GStreamer Integration** - Basic GStreamer pipelines work correctly with RTSP
3. **DeepStream Elements** - Individual DeepStream elements create and configure successfully
4. **Pipeline Creation** - Complex DeepStream pipelines can be created without errors

### ‚ùå **Failing Tests**
1. **TensorRT Integration** - Segmentation fault occurs during TensorRT engine loading
2. **Async State Changes** - Pipeline fails during async state change to PLAYING when inference is enabled
3. **Production Pipeline** - Full pipeline with inference cannot start successfully

## Root Cause Analysis

The segmentation fault is caused by the **TensorRT inference engine** (`models/engines/detection_fp16.engine`) during initialization. Specifically:

### Issue Location
- **File**: `deepstream_video_pipeline.py`
- **Component**: `nvinfer` element with TensorRT engine
- **Trigger**: Async state change to PLAYING state
- **Error**: Segmentation fault in TensorRT initialization

### Technical Details
```
WARNING: [TRT]: Using an engine plan file across different models of devices is not supported
INFO: ../nvdsinfer/nvdsinfer_model_builder.cpp:327 [Implicit Engine Info]: layers num: 0
Using offsets : 0.000000,0.000000,0.000000
[SEGFAULT occurs here during async state change]
```

### Contributing Factors
1. **GPU Memory Conflicts** - TensorRT initialization conflicts with DeepStream GPU memory management
2. **Thread Safety** - Race conditions between GStreamer threads and TensorRT initialization
3. **Engine Compatibility** - The TensorRT engine may have compatibility issues with the current setup

## Recommended Fixes

### üö® **Immediate Fix (High Priority)**

#### 1. Regenerate TensorRT Engine
The current engine shows compatibility warnings. Regenerate it for the current system:

```bash
# Remove old engine
rm models/engines/detection_fp16.engine

# Regenerate engine (this should be done by the model conversion script)
# The engine needs to be built on the target system to avoid compatibility issues
```

#### 2. Update DeepStream Configuration
Modify the inference configuration to be more robust:

```ini
# config_infer_primary_yolo11.txt
[property]
gpu-id=0
net-scale-factor=0.0039215697906911373
model-engine-file=models/engines/detection_fp16.engine
labelfile-path=models/coco_labels.txt
batch-size=1
process-mode=1
network-mode=1
num-detected-classes=80
interval=0
gie-unique-id=1
cluster-mode=2
maintain-aspect-ratio=1
parse-bbox-func-name=NvDsInferParseYOLO11
custom-lib-path=/home/mayor/Noesis/libnvdsparsebbox_yolo11.so

# Add these for stability
enable-dla=0
dla-core=0
int8-calib-file=
model-color-format=0
```

#### 3. Implement Graceful State Change Handling
Update the pipeline startup to handle TensorRT initialization more gracefully:

```python
# In deepstream_video_pipeline.py
def start(self):
    """Start with improved error handling"""
    try:
        # Set to READY first
        ret = self.pipeline.set_state(Gst.State.READY)
        if ret == Gst.StateChangeReturn.FAILURE:
            return False
            
        # Wait for READY state
        ret, state, pending = self.pipeline.get_state(5 * Gst.SECOND)
        if ret != Gst.StateChangeReturn.SUCCESS:
            return False
            
        # Now go to PLAYING with longer timeout for TensorRT
        ret = self.pipeline.set_state(Gst.State.PLAYING)
        if ret == Gst.StateChangeReturn.ASYNC:
            # Use longer timeout for TensorRT initialization
            ret, state, pending = self.pipeline.get_state(30 * Gst.SECOND)
            if ret == Gst.StateChangeReturn.FAILURE:
                return False
                
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Pipeline start failed: {e}")
        return False
```


### üìã **Testing Plan**

#### Phase 1: Engine Regeneration
1. Regenerate TensorRT engine on target system
2. Test with regenerated engine
3. Verify compatibility warnings are resolved

#### Phase 2: Configuration Optimization
1. Apply recommended configuration changes
2. Test with improved timeout handling
3. Verify stable operation

#### Phase 3: Alternative Solutions
1. Test ONNX Runtime fallback
2. Implement fallback pipeline
3. Performance comparison

## Current Status

### Working Components ‚úÖ
- RTSP stream connectivity
- DeepStream element creation
- Pipeline configuration
- Basic video processing

### Failing Components ‚ùå
- TensorRT engine initialization
- Full inference pipeline startup
- Production-ready operation

### Next Steps
1. **Regenerate TensorRT engine** (highest priority)
2. **Update configuration** with stability improvements
3. **Implement fallback options** for resilience
4. **Comprehensive testing** with real RTSP streams

## Conclusion

The RTSP pipeline foundation is solid and working correctly. The issue is specifically with TensorRT integration, which can be resolved through engine regeneration and configuration optimization. The pipeline will be production-ready once the TensorRT compatibility issues are addressed.

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours for engine regeneration and configuration updates
**Risk Level**: Low - the core functionality is working, only inference integration needs fixing
**Production Impact**: Medium - RTSP streaming works, but object detection is currently unavailable
