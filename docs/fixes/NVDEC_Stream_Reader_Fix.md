# NVDEC Stream Reader Fix: Dynamic Resolution Support

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The original `NVDECVideoReader._read_frames()` method had a critical flaw that caused FFmpeg processes to die after ~2 minutes:

```python
# ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE
raw_frame = self.process.stdout.read(frame_size)
if len(raw_frame) != frame_size:
    print(f"Incomplete frame: got {len(raw_frame)}, expected {frame_size}")
    continue  # DISCARDS BYTES - causes permanent stream desynchronization
```

### Additional Critical Issues Found
1. **Initialization Bug**: `expected_frame_size = 0` in constructor prevented frame extraction logic from ever executing
2. **Blocking Read Risk**: Direct `stdout.read()` could block without `select()` check
3. **Buffer Logic**: Frame extraction condition `and expected_frame_size > 0` was never satisfied

### Why This Failed
1. **Network Fragmentation**: TCP packets don't align with frame boundaries
2. **Buffering Issues**: FFmpeg's stdout buffer writes may be partial
3. **Byte Discarding**: Any partial read was discarded, causing permanent misalignment
4. **Stream Desync**: After a few discarded partial reads, we're reading at wrong byte offsets
5. **Process Death**: FFmpeg eventually hits EOF when stdout is consumed incorrectly
6. **Logic Never Executed**: Zero frame size meant buffered reader never extracted frames

## Solution: Robust Buffered Stream Reader

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Fixed Critical Initialization Bug**
```python
# ❌ OLD: Frame extraction never worked
self.expected_frame_size = 0

# ✅ NEW: Proper initialization
self.expected_frame_size = self.width * self.height * 3  # Initial calculation
```

#### 2. **Buffered Accumulation (Never Discard Bytes)**
```python
# ✅ NEW APPROACH
# Use select() to prevent blocking
ready, _, _ = select.select([self.process.stdout], [], [], 0.1)
if ready:
    chunk = self.process.stdout.read(65536)  # Read whatever is available
    self.frame_buffer.extend(chunk)          # Accumulate ALL bytes

# Extract complete frames when buffer has enough data
while len(self.frame_buffer) >= self.expected_frame_size and self.expected_frame_size > 0:
    frame_data = self.frame_buffer[:self.expected_frame_size]
    self.frame_buffer = self.frame_buffer[self.expected_frame_size:]  # Remove used bytes
```

#### 3. **Non-blocking Read Protection**
```python
# Check data availability before reading to prevent blocking
ready, _, _ = select.select([self.process.stdout], [], [], 0.1)
if ready:
    chunk = self.process.stdout.read(65536)
    if not chunk:
        print("EOF reached on FFmpeg stdout")
        break
```

#### 4. **Dynamic Resolution Support**
- Keeps original FFprobe-based resolution detection at startup
- Adds `_redetect_resolution()` for runtime resolution changes
- Handles resolution changes gracefully without process restart

#### 5. **Stream Resynchronization**
```python
try:
    frame = np.frombuffer(frame_data, dtype=np.uint8)
    frame = frame.reshape((self.height, self.width, 3))
except ValueError:
    # Frame reshape failed - likely resolution change
    if self._redetect_resolution():
        self.frame_buffer.clear()  # Resync stream
```

#### 6. **Continuous Stderr Monitoring**
- Dedicated thread drains FFmpeg stderr continuously
- Prevents potential deadlock if FFmpeg becomes verbose
- Stores recent messages in ring buffer for debugging

### Implementation Details

#### New Instance Variables
```python
self.frame_buffer = bytearray()              # Persistent byte accumulator
self.expected_frame_size = width * height * 3  # Proper initialization (CRITICAL FIX)
self.stderr_buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=100)  # Recent stderr messages
self.stderr_thread = None                    # Stderr monitoring thread
```

#### Thread Management
- **Main Thread**: `_read_frames()` - buffered frame extraction with non-blocking reads
- **Stderr Thread**: `_monitor_stderr()` - continuous stderr drain
- Both threads are daemon threads with proper cleanup in `stop()`

### Benefits

1. **✅ Handles Network Fragmentation**: Accumulates partial reads properly
2. **✅ Dynamic Resolution Support**: No fixed resolution constraints
3. **✅ Stream Resilience**: Recovers from temporary decode issues
4. **✅ GPU-Only Enforcement**: Maintains strict GPU pipeline
5. **✅ Fail-Hard Policy**: Real hardware errors still cause immediate failure
6. **✅ Zero CPU Fallbacks**: Preserves original performance characteristics
7. **✅ Non-blocking Operations**: Prevents thread deadlocks and blocking issues
8. **✅ Proper Initialization**: Frame extraction logic now actually executes

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Initialization Bug
- **Before**: `expected_frame_size = 0` → frame extraction never executed
- **After**: `expected_frame_size = width * height * 3` → proper frame extraction

#### Fix 2: Non-blocking Read Safety
- **Before**: `stdout.read(65536)` could block indefinitely
- **After**: `select()` check before read prevents blocking

#### Fix 3: EOF Handling
- **Before**: Empty reads caused infinite loops
- **After**: EOF detection breaks loop cleanly

### Testing Validation

The fix addresses the original symptoms:
- **Before**: FFmpeg processes died with code 0 after ~2 minutes
- **After**: Processes should run indefinitely with proper frame extraction
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Any resolution stream can be plugged in without code changes
- **Logic Verification**: Frame extraction condition now evaluates to `True` when data is available

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal CPU Overhead**: Buffering operations are lightweight
- **Memory Usage**: Small increase (~1-2MB per stream for frame buffer)
- **GPU Pipeline**: Unchanged - all downstream processing remains GPU-only
- **Latency**: Potential 1-2ms improvement due to elimination of blocking reads
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved due to proper initialization and non-blocking I/O

## Configuration

No configuration changes required. The reader automatically:
1. Detects native resolution at startup
2. Adapts to resolution changes during runtime  
3. Handles any compatible codec input dynamically
4. Initializes frame extraction logic properly

## Monitoring

Enhanced logging provides better visibility:
- Resolution detection and changes
- Frame extraction statistics
- FFmpeg stderr messages (errors/warnings only)
- Buffer synchronization events
- EOF detection and process termination
