# Phase 1.2.2 Complete: TensorRT Performance Optimization

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact**: Batch processing, engine optimization validation, memory workspace analysis

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Engine optimization validation framework
- ✅ Batch processing with queue management
- ✅ Optimal batch size detection
- ✅ Memory workspace validation
- ✅ Unified memory pool integration

## Files Created/Modified
- Created: `tensorrt_optimization.py` - Complete optimization framework
- Modified: `tensorrt_inference.py` already had unified memory pool integration

## Key Features
- **Batch Processing**: Automatic batch formation with timeout management
- **Engine Analysis**: Validates FP16, dynamic shapes, workspace size
- **Optimization**: Finds optimal batch sizes through benchmarking
- **Memory**: Uses unified memory pool for efficient tensor management
